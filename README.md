# compiladores_trabalho1
Assignment from compilators class - a very rudimentary C compiler
It does not include the entire assignment because I didn't finish it - both stack.c and stack.h are files from the second part of the assignment (both stack.c and stack.h are from the second part). It doesn't work very well, I think with the while instruction.


## instructions:
   to create open the terminal and:
   ```Shell
   make
   ```

   to clean up the mess:
   ```Shell
   make clean
   ```
   
   to run
   ```Shell
   ./interpreter < file.c
   ```
